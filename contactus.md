If you would like to contact us here are the best methods:

## Press

Press can contact press@pirateparty.ca to schedule interviews, ask questions, and setup phone calls. Emails are generally responded to within 1 hour during standard business hours (PST). 

***Please note***: While we will make every effort to respond to emails in the language we recieve them; to ensure clear messaging we, unfortunately, will only do interviews in English. 

## Public / Members

You may contact us at info@pirateparty.ca with all your questions. Like press requests we generally like to get back to the public within 1 hour during standard business hours (PST), but please allow up to 48 hours for us to get back to you.

Our primary method of party communication is on IRC. [Members](https://sso.pirateparty.ca) have access to our web based IRC client, while anyone else may connect using any IRC client to our server at irc.pirateparty.ca in #Canada. For help connecting to IRC please email us at info@pirateparty.ca and we will be happy to help!
