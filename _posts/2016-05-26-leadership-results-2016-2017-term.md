Formerly, we&#8217;ve had just one leader at a time. This is a new experimental form of organizing within the PPCA that we would like to continue.In addition to our three leaders we also have an additional group of co-leaders, members of our political council and executive board. They are: James Phillips (Edmonton,) Travis McCrea (Vancouver,) Eric Adriaans (Toronto,) Cory Svennson (Kelowna,) and Ryan Bromsgrove (Edmonton.)</p>

As our country approaches its 150th year, the question has still not receive a truly universal answer. Indeed, since our confederation, there has only been cross-cultural communication between the French, the British, and the Aboriginal, alongside every other culture present within Canada. Nothing truly unique has emerged; the mosaic of Canada appears merely as a jumble of coloured tiles, while the tapestry of Canada presents no image.  </span>

The PPCA aims to establish greater growth in our country: intellectually, artistically, and economically. Every single policy is designed for these purposes.  </span>

Our job is to curate, tweak, and re-distribute the tactics, ideas, and policies of other parties and political cultures. We&#8217;re believers in polyculture, civil rights, and the political power of leisure. We believe in all-information-to-everyone. We believe in no-bullshit-jobs. We believe in attribution-as-accountability. </span>

The pirate party is a do-ocracy which means that your time and effort are valued. Your vote, as a member and activist, is proportional to the work that you put in. We don&#8217;t believe in the vulgar bureaucracy of old politics. We are disordered by design. We believe in a democracy that emphasizes openness and participatory freedom over endless rounds of voting. We empower each other. Our goal is to get elected so we can empower voters in this same way.</span>
