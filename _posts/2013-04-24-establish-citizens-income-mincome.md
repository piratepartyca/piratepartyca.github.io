In Dauphin, Manitoba in the 1970&#8217;s, Canada tried an experimental minimum income (&#8220;mincome&#8221;) program.Â  The results were encouraging, but it was shut down by an incoming federal government and its results were locked away without study. We want to revive the mincome program, first on an experimental level to prove feasibility, and then on a national level. A Citizen&#8217;s Income is an unconditional, non-withdrawable income payable to each individual as a right of citizenship. Consumer spending drives the economy, and we acknowledge that without a basic amount of spending money you do not have much freedom to speak of.
