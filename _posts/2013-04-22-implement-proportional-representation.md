We see proportional representation as vital part of election reform, ensuring that government properly represents everyone, and that everyone&#8217;s voice matters in elections. We intend to restart the national debate and push for a system of proportional representation to be implemented for all elections in Canada. The new system will ensure that elected government have a real majority of support and strategic voting becomes obsolete and unnecessary.
