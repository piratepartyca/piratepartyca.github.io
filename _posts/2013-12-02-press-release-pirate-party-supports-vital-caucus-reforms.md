Fox Creek, AB &#8211; December 1

It was reported on Friday that Conservative MP Michael Chong is tabling a bill to enact major changes to the relationship between party leaders and their caucuses. The reforms would give MPs the ability to schedule a non-confidence motion in their leader if 15% of the caucus agrees and potentially remove their leader if 50% plus one of the caucus vote to do so. The caucus would also be in charge of determining its own membership, not the party leader. The reform would also remove the requirement for the party leader&#8217;s signature for candidates in elections. Instead, the riding associations themselves would get final say on who is to be their candidate.

The requirement for a candidate to have the leader&#8217;s signature to run has only existed since the 1970s. The lack of leaderÂ  accountability to the caucus has been around for a bit longer, arising in the 1930s. Originally party leaders were chosen by the caucus but the demands for a more democratic selection led to the first national conventions. Unfortunately, the party leaders realized quickly that they were now more than leaders of their caucuses, they were masters of them. Many of the problems in Parliament can be traced back to the immense power wielded by the party leaders. This reform bill will correct the power imbalance that has arose between party leaders and their MPs without losing the democratic nature of party leader selection.

&#8220;These reforms are huge. There was a time when MPs, like R.B. Bennett, could absolutely skewer their own party&#8217;s record on the floor of Commons and have a reasonable chance of becoming party leader themselves one day. Fast forward to 2013 and such a person would be persona non grata, most likely forever. The leaders in Parliament would have it no other way, as seen by the Conservatives, Liberals and New Democrats already coming out against it&#8221;, says James Wilson, Leader of the Pirate Party of Canada. The Pirate Party supports MP Michael Chong private members bill and will be calling on its members and the general public to contact their MPs encouraging them to support these vital reforms. The party will also be opposing attempts to either water down this bill or destroy it with &#8216;poison pill&#8217; amendments.

The Pirate Party of Canada is a federal political party focused on thoughtful information policy reform, genuine democracy, civil liberties, and the freedom of the Internet. You can find out more online at [www.pirateparty.ca](http://www.pirateparty.ca){.extern} .
