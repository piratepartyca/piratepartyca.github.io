**The Pirate Party of Canada is growing rapidly** and we&#8217;d like to invite you come on board and participate as we change the face of politics in Canada. Whether you&#8217;re a member, a potential candidate, or simply concerned about some of the issues with which we are engaged, we invite you to join our crew and be part of our growth.

**Currently, we are:**

  * Building local groups
  * Organizing events both on and offline
  * Keeping our members up to date.
  * Making pirate party artwork, websites, and campaigns.
  * Reaching out to new members.

**And to do all these things we need:**

  * People who like to make music, videos, art, animate, code, and edit.
