I have owned a few torrent websites in my life, and one thing I have learned from this venture was people will upload anything and everything and if we wanted to go through everything it would be physically impossible with a staff less than 100. It&#8217;s impossible to know who uploaded what content and who owns the rights to what so when we learned to day that the dotPH registry has suspended the kat.ph domain name we were upset at their technological ignorance.

For those of you who don&#8217;t know what a torrent site is and what a torrent file does, a torrent site is simply a website that keeps an index of many torrent files and allows users to comment and vote on the quality of these files. Many bands and organizations use torrent files, I download each new Ubuntu distro using a torrent since it is a much faster method than http.

A torrent file is basically a map, it contains no copyrighted material on it&#8217;s own and rather tells a torrent client what server it can connect to, so it can connect to other people with the same torrent file who are sharing the right file. It seriously would be no different than making map software available, a person could use it to create a map to a bank to rob but that does not make the software bad.

We can argue the benefits of &#8220;piracy&#8221; and show how a download doesn&#8217;t mean a lost sale but we can debate until we are blue in the face on that. The issue today is Kickass Torrents, and it&#8217;s sad that an ignorant society would make your life difficult. We wish them well and hope that it&#8217;s users are able to quickly find the new address (kickass.to).

KAT staff, if you need a .ca domain name which should be a little more stable &#8211; shoot us a message, if the party can&#8217;t register it for you (it should be able to) &#8211; I will do it myself.
