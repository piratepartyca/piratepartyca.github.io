**The following policiesÂ have been approved by the Political Council and will be sent to the membership to be voted on:**

> -We will establish a system of automatic licences for copyright and patents. Innovators will be able to pay a flat fee for the right to use works of intellectual property held by another. This is similar to the provisions made for &#8216;cover songs&#8217; in the music industry.
> 
> &nbsp;
> 
> -As the intellectual property holders will not be able to reject an automatic licence request we will set the royalties received from sales of products using their intellectual property at a level above the market rate as a means of compensation.
> 
> &nbsp;
> 
> -Licence fees for intellectual property whose owner is not known (known as &#8216;orphaned works&#8217; in copyright) will be paid to the government. The government will hold onto the payment until the intellectual property holder is identified.
