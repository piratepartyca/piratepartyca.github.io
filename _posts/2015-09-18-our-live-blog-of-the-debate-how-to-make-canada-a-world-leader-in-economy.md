Here is the complete list of our responses to the Globe Economy Debate from our live blog. It ends up being semi-live as our leader was only able to join in to the PVR recorded debate one hour after (8 pm Central).

**Question 1: Jobs**
  
Canada is facing structural, rather than cyclical change. Do you have a job plan, beyond taking things out of the ground?

Response: Restructuring Canadian economy through Mincome or Basic Income Guarantee (B.I.G.)

**Question 2: Energy & Environment**
  
In the last campaign, the NDP put a cost of $21 billion on its carbon-pricing policy. What is the cost of your planned cap-and-trade proposal?

Response: Moving toward a new information and energy economy.

**Question 3: Infrastructure**
  
You are committed to taking us into deficit to fund your infrastructure plan. Spending money is an easy promise. What does success look like?

Response: Fixing the infrastructure and municipal budget deficit once and for all.

**Question 4: Immigration and the Economy**
  
All parties agree immigration is central to Canada&#8217;s long-term economic strategy. What is the right balance between economic migrants and those seeking family reunification?

Response: Immigrants are not to be feared and how they can help Canada&#8217;s economy grow.

**Question 5: Housing**
  
Canadians have been on a borrowing binge to buy ever more expensive homes. What would you do to guard against a housing bubble?

Response: Cause of housing bubble, preventative measures and its positive effects. Ending the tax credits and ballooning taxes.

**Question 6: Taxation**
  
You will raise the corporate tax rate from the current 15% to 17% What economic, rather than political, reason justifies your decision?

Response: Pro- and anti-corporation rhetoric misses the point. Small business vs monopolistic corporation and how to create a competitive Open Market.

(Our retort to the leader&#8217;s responses: Making our economy sustainable and stopping the continuous tax increases.Â <http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1snfq07>{.extern})

Leader&#8217;s debate on: **Creating a New Economy**

Response: How to actually create a new knowledge and information based economy. You cannot talk about economy without even mentioning poverty.
