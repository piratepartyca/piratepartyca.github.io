The current method of looking at drug issues as a legal issue is severely flawed and undermines healthcare professionals from offering recovery programs and safe spaces for users of those drugs. The Pirate Party of Canada stands with the advice of doctors and for their Section 7 rights to provide safe and effective treatment for drug abuse and addiction.

Drug legalization is a long road and we must evaluate the longterm effects of our decisions. Looking at current trials in other countries and the limited amount of data we have now, it is our position that drugs can be made safer and better controls can be established for their access if they are legal and produced by licensed locations. Tax money can be spent on healthcare and drug abuse programs, and excess should be spent on education.

No matter the path we take, we must first and foremost use compassion and evidence, not fear, to inform our decisions.
