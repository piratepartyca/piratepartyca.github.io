We might not have millions to spent on advertising, but if one person from one riding donate to pay for a sign, we can help raise awareness and possibly get prospective local candidates to join us.

Pledge to pre-order now. Pay only when we hit the minimum number of pre-orders (12) in one major centres. We will notify you via e-mail when we are ready to order and have started accepting payments. Please make sure to provide your e-mail address.
