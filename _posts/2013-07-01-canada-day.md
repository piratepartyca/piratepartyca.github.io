This weekend I had the great pleasure of meeting up with Ric Lim, our insanely hard working secretary; Andrew Paolucci, our dedicated IT director; and Patrick Fitzgerald, political council member and head of the project development committee. I am so proud to work along side each of them and the entire team that volunteers their time for the Pirate Party.

Canada Day is about celebrating our nations birthday, and while sometimes, due to the political system stacked against us, all the work we put into the party feels in vain. Today is a great day to remember that what we are doing is worth it, and not only that but the energy you as members and supporters give us is worth it. Canada is worth fighting for, and we will spend every day making sure we do what we can to promote equality, empowerment, and protect civil liberties.

I also had a chance to review all the letters and donations made to us from our signature drive. We have received over $1,200 in donations (all cheques should be processed tomorrow, for those wondering), and wonderful letters from you &#8212; telling us to keep fighting, and thanking the Pirate Party for it&#8217;s work. I was touched and have a renewed vigor (you refreshed my mana) to keep fighting for this party. This is such a wonderful movement and I am proud that you allowed me to be a part of it.

Happy Canada Day, enjoy the fireworks and festivities&#8230; please stay safe tonight and let&#8217;s keep  making this party the best it can be.

Fair Winds,
