Canada&#8217;s military spending should be focused on our conventional peacekeeping forces, especially on forces that can be rapidly deployed. Airborne forces, infantry and other front line units bear the brunt of operations in the 21st century and should be prioritized. The fact Canada&#8217;s military has such old and worn out equipment is a danger to the troops who protect us.

The world is quickly leaving the era of countries fighting other countries, and the Pirate Party proposes that we re-focus the military into a global peace force and reduce our spending on offensive weaponry, including tanks and air-to-air combat vehicles.
