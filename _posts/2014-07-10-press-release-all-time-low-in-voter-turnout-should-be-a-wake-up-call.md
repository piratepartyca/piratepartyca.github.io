  The by-elections held last week have officially set a new low for voter turnout with less than 20% turnout in the two Alberta races. Part of the reason for this is believed to be the election date which was set to occur right before Canada Day. While by-election turnout is generally lower on average the government should try to avoid making the problem worse. The Pirate Party of Canada believes that it was irresponsible to pick such a date to hold any type of election and wants stricter laws regulating when by-elections can be scheduled for.

  Currently, the Prime Minister can have a by-election set for any date provided it is not more than 180 days after the vacancy occurred. This allows the governing party to pick a time that is strictly to their advantage (as some have suggested occurred in this instance). While by-elections usually have a low turnout it is hard to deny that the timing of these by-election made it even worse.

  &#8220;Canada should be committed to limiting the manipulation of the electorate through cheap tricks&#8221;, says James Wilson, Leader of the Pirate Party of Canada. &#8220;Can we not agree on something as simple as making elections as fair as possible?&#8221; If elected the Pirate Party would introduce legislation banning the holding of by-elections from five days before, and five days after, all national statutory holidays.
