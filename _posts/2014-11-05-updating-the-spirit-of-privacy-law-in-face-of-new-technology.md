We will update the Criminal Code to ensure that use of newer and/or untested technological means to accomplish something that would be a privacy violation if a person physically did it themselves is also illegal (such as using a drone to commit voyeurism). An act that would have otherwise been legal or illegal using more conventional methods will be treated accordingly as having accomplished the act with conventional means.

**The following policies have been approved by the Political Council and will be sent to the membership to be voted on:**

> -We will update the Criminal Code to ensure that use of newer and/or untested technological means cannot be used to circumvent the spirit of privacy laws. For example, voyeurism assisted by a drone would be treated the same as if done in person.
