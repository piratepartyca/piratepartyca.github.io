Canada puts a great deal of funds towards research into illnesses affecting Canadians. Researchers are able to apply for grants that help expand medical knowledge and lead to cures. However, research into ageing cannot benefit as ageing is not classified as an illness.

By opening up funding to those researching ageing we stand to improve the quality of life of the elderlyÂ by not only extending old age but extending healthy old age.
