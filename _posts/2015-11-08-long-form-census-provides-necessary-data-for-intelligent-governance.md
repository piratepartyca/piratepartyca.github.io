  <span><strong>LONG-FORM CENSUS PROVIDES NECESSARY DATA FOR INTELLIGENT GOVERNANCE</strong></span>
</p>

<span></span>
  
<span>Victoria, BC &#8211; 8 Nov 2015 &#8211; Yesterday, the Liberal Government announced the reinstatement of the mandatory long-form census. By having the census in place in time for 2016, we can ensure that the proper information is available to make good, evidence-based decisions regarding government services, the economy, and immigration. The Pirate Party of Canada would like to thank the Liberal Government for taking a strong first step toward setting up an evidence-based government. By reversing the Harper Government&#8217;s ideological cancellation of the long-form census, Canadians can be assured that good, reliable data can be now be used to help constituents across the country.</span>

<span>&#8220;The long-form census provides businesses and governments with valuable information that can help with planning and implementing everything from social programs through business expansion,&#8221; says Shawn Gray, the Pirate Party of Canada&#8217;s International Trade, Small Business and Tourism Critic. The long-form census is used to gather a variety of subjects, including things like income, housing, child care and support payments, labour market activities, unpaid/household work, citizenship and immigration status, ethnic origin, religion, place of birth of parents, and education. As a result, the long-form census becomes an &#8220;anchor&#8221; to eliminate bias in surveys. Additionally, it is vital in providing the government with the information it needs to make informed decisions, measure equality, and plan public programs and projects such as equalization payments, Employment Insurance benefits, the Old Age Security program, and the Canada Pension Plan. Because the data gathered through the long-form census is available freely through the Stats Canada website, Canadians, local businesses, and international organizations are able to make use of the information to help understand the different markets across the country and how they are changing over time. </span>

<span>The Pirate Party of Canada is a federal political party focused on thoughtful information policy reform, genuine democracy, civil liberties, open data, and the freedom of the Internet.
