The delivery of services to government is littered with stories of companies exceeding budgets and delivering late. We will implement penalties for significant performance failures for government suppliers. If a company fails to deliver a government within 25% of budget or 25% of the deadline then that company (its parent organisations and subsidiaries) would be banned from providing services or products to the government for at least 2 years.
