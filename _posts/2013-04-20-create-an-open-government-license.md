  The Open Government Licence will  include all government funded data and material. All maps, statistics and other data that have been created or collated by the government will be  released in open formats, giving the public access to research for which they have already paid. The sole exception relating to information that would invade the privacy of others and the national security, integrity and legal interests of the Government of Canada and it&#8217;s allies. Content that no longer threaten National Security must be declassified. The end goal being the removal of the ability of the federal government to apply a copyright to documents produced by federal government departments.
