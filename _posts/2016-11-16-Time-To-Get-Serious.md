Over the past month as leader, I have been attempting to bring our party back from the ashes and really turn it into a meaningful part of the Canadian political discussion. This isn't an effort made alone, but through the hard work and dedication of our members and now it's time to ramp it up.

Our platforms are currently in need of review. I am doing an in-depth look into our platforms and will be working within the rules of the party to ensure they are updated as quickly as possible to meet my standards. I have already started working with a team of francophone volunteers to ensure our website and platforms are properly translated into French.

It will now be an emphasis by the leadership of the party to focus at least a bit of energy into fundraising. This doesn't mean harassing you with emails begging for money every day, that isn't us. It does mean reminding our members when possible that it costs money to run a party, and it costs even more money to make sure other people hear about us.

Finally, no more passive Pirate Party, we are a legitimate option for Canadians looking for a party with real solutions for the 21st century. Basic Income is the solution to job automation, homelessness, and other issues Canadians face today and will face in the near future. We are the only party talking about that, and we need to remind people of this. We also need to call out other parties when they do wrong, or when they show their ignorance to technology and the future of Canada.

It's the 21st century, it's time for 21st century politics. The Pirate Party is here, and we are ready to serve you. Let's do this!
