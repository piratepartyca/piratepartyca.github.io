Canada is an immigrant nation. It is built on collaborations between citizens from diverse backgrounds. Canada, at its best, serves as aÂ  microcosm for the international community. Collaboration and kinship between all cultures and nationalities

From an economic perspective, the demand for certain skills that are in short supply in Canada has made immigration vitally important for both the public and the private sector. Well- managed and well-controlled immigration is important to ensure that Canada remains competitive and innovative. We will therefore ensure that immigration is well managed by ensuring that record keeping related to entry into and departure from Canada is suitable. Without detailed information about the flow of people into and out of the country it will become difficult to ensure that the areas where immigrants are settling are able to cope with both changes in the level of demand and changes in demographics.

Immigration applications should be considered not only on the basis of what skills an immigrant brings to his sponsor and whether an applicant is able to support themselves without any recourse to public funds, but also where the applicant is intending to live and work.
