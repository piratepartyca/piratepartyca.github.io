The Pirate Party of Canada will abolish university tuition fees. Studies have shown that education is directly linked to our GDP<sup><a class="extern" href="http://education-portal.com/articles/New_Study_Links_Education_to_Economic_Growth.html">Source</a></sup>, and as we approach peak jobs due to automation, society must retool itself for life after convenience and factory workers. Furthermore, our government can afford to spent billions in fighter planes, with a little bit of readjustment of priority, few billions could be set aside to invest in post-secondary education to help make us a world leader in knowledge and skill based economy.
