Fox Creek, AB – January 20th

On January 15th at the Monthly General Meeting of the Pirate Party of Canada three more candidates were confirmed for the 2015 Federal Election. The candidates are Craig Nobbs for the riding of Langley-Aldergrove (BC), Kenneth Dyson for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce Westmount (QC), and James Wilson for Fundy Royal (NB). All three candidates are also committed to running in any by-elections that may occur in their ridings before 2015.

Craig Nobbs previously ran for the party in the Langley riding in the 2011 Federal Election. Kenneth Dyson is a researcher in the Department of Neuroscience at Université de Montréal. James Wilson is the current party leader and a recent graduate of Mount Allison University. They join three previously confirmed candidates: Travis McCrea, David Ascroft, and Robert McGrath.

&#8220;It is time to inject science and reason into the national discourse. Partisan politics has taken us to the brink of social, economic, and natural disaster.  Instead of arguing over ideological differences, let us invest in finding the evidence so that we can have substantive, rational debates.&#8221;, says Kenneth Dyson, candidate for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce Westmount. The Pirate Party is committed to fielding the best team of candidates for 2015.

The Pirate Party of Canada is a federal political party focused on thoughtful information policy reform, genuine democracy, civil liberties, and the freedom of the Internet. You can find out more online at <a class="extern" href="http://www.pirateparty.ca/" target="_blank">www.pirateparty.ca</a> .
