No extradition should be permitted where a Canadian judges deems that an extradition would not be in the interests of justice. We will ensure that Canadian judges have the power to halt an extradition until they were satisfied that a case is trial ready, as well as the power to refuse extradition where the country seeking extradition is clearly not the appropriate place for trial.

We would also seek clearer rules to deal with cases where there is a multinational aspect to ensure cases are handled transparently and fairly. We would address the perceived imbalance in the US-Canada extradition treaty by requiring that the standards for extradition being granted and the information required to assess each case are the same whether an extradition request comes from the US or Canada. Any extradition treaty must not only be fair, it must also be perceived as fair by the public. Through raising public confidence in government the best possible environment for great minds to shape the world of tomorrow.
