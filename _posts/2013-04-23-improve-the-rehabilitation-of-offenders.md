We will introduce significant reforms to the system of rehabilitation of offenders in Canada. The current recidivism rate is around 50%, in part due to discrimination against former prisoners after release. The Pirate Party will propose removing the requirement to declare spent criminal convictions and toughen legislation making it illegal to discriminate against people with spent convictions.
