Vancouver &#8211; The Pirate Party of Canada is pleased to see the sudden change of leadership in Alberta. Rachel Notley’s NDP has displaced the ruling Progressive Conservative party as the majority government of the province after a seemingly permanent 44 years in power. This is a dramatic step to the left in a province that is traditionally identified as a hotbed of conservatism.

&#8220;The NDP have won an encouraging victory tonight,” said Pirate Party Secretary Nate Owen. “But PC Alberta should be congratulated, too, on their hard won 11 seats with 27% of votes. Perhaps the call for proportional representation will get a little more attention &#8211; from a variety of parties.&#8221;

The Progressive Conservatives would have received more than double their current seats (24) in a proportional representation system.

“The NDP was by the Pirate Party’s closest cousin in this race.” said Pirate Party Candidate Bob Trower, “We’re particularly pleased to see Rachel Notley as incumbent Premier. We need to push harder to get women into leadership positions until there is a reasonable balance.”

Both the federal Pirate Party and the federal NDP have been ardent opposers of the spying Bill C-51.

“This is the power of young, new, and tech-enabled voters coming out to change the face of Canada. The public has never been more informed. ” said Deputy Leader Shawn Vulliez today. “The winds of change have come thanks to the free transfer of information on the internet. Get used to that happening.”

The Pirate Party of Canada is a federal political party dedicated to information policy, the decriminalization of filesharing, and the establishment of a Guaranteed Annual Income for all.
