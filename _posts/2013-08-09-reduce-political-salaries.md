With the salary increase adopted in 2013 Canadian MPs now make $160,200 yearly. This figure is higher than that of politicians in Great Britain, Australia and several other industrial nations. This is unacceptable when Canadians are being asked to make due with less.

To help our federal politicians lead by example the salary of all MPs and Senators will be reduced to $100,000 yearly.
