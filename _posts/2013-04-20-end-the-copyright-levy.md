Blank CDs and DVDs represent an important tool for new artists to sell their music at concerts and events. However they, along with the general public, are charged 19 cents for each CD or DVD. This money is divided among major artists based on sales, not actual levels of piracy. As a result new artists just starting out are both unfairly taxed and denied access to funds from the levy. We believe this is both structurally unfair to new artists and a cash grab by the major labels. This corporate welfare must end.

**The following policiesÂ have been approved by the Political Council and will be sent to the membership to be voted on:**

> -We will seek to abolish the copyright levy.
