We will promote the provision of free public WiFi as well as the provision of Internet access in community centres and libraries by local authorities. At present a significant portion of us have limited access to the Internet and the benefits that access provides. Providing access where it is otherwise limited is a good initial step to reducing and eventually ending the digital divide.
