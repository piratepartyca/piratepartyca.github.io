        I&#8217;m looking for Pirates in Greater Victoria that would like to get together. I&#8217;d like to see what we can muster here and if there&#8217;s any interest in putting someone forward for the 2015 election. Please post or e-mail me (rintaran at gmail) your interest. I like the idea of one-on-one meetings in advance of putting together a Greater Victoria Pirate meeting to hash out what we can do locally.
