There&#8217;s very little genuine and accessible public space in Canada; whether you are looking for it online or offline, but there are many places that are private and yet modern life strongly encourages you into, like shopping centres, walkways, parks and open spaces around churches and other buildings.These spaces become so important to people, that it is time to recognizing that citizens have rights in them, despite being private places.

The Pirate Party intends to define a legal notion of &#8220;pseudo-public space&#8221; which is space that, while privately owned, has become so woven into the lives of citizens, and so essential to their daily routines, that they any rights that they might enjoy in a public place also apply.

**The following policies have been approved by the Political Council and will be sent to the membership to be voted on:**
