**Toronto** &#8211; The Pirate Party of Canada is launching it&#8217;s first comprehensive policy, with topics ranging from defence to health, we want to better represent Canadians and give a clear picture as to what our party is about.

&#8220;The Pirate Party is a progressive movement, and it is time that our party step up and outline what it is that we stand for.&#8221; States party leader, Travis McCrea. &#8220;Mincome was effective before, and other basic income programs are showing success internationally; Drug patents are over burdening our provincial health providers; and we are fighting a senseless war on drugs. My party is ready to stand up for science and rational thought, something Canada desperately needs.&#8221;

When campaigning in election 41 in Vancouver-Centre, Travis McCrea had talked to many seniors who were unable to afford their medications. This was what inspired him to look into medications and drug patents, and what he found drove him to seek reform in the area.

The current tax system is too complicated, especially for web businesses. Who knows what is supposed to be taxed and what isn&#8217;t when you are just sharing your hobby on ebay or kijiji? Small businesses and startups should not have to hire an accountant, and so another major focus will be on making taxes simpler: especially for startups and online businesses.

The Pirate Party recognizes that with a First Past the Post voting system, it is important to outline a general policy for constituents to know exactly who they are voting for. While we don&#8217;t like the current electoral system (and indeed, it is a part of our new platform to fix it), we are going to work harder to appeal to a broader audience.
