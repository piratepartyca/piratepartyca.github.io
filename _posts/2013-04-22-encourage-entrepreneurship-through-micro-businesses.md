We will promote micro-business as a driver for innovation and competition in the Canadian economy. A micro-business is a very small business with a single owner and no employees, one with a turnover of less than $2500/year. The first $1500 of income earned from micro-business would be tax free, nor would the income from such an operation have an impact on benefits.
