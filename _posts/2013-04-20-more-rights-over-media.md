We will legalise the use of copyright works where no money changes hands, which will return to the people various rights including:

  * A right to “format shift” (for example, buying a CD then copying it to a portable media player such as an MP3 player or phone);
  * A right to share files between friends and peers (which provides free advertising that is essential for less well-known artists);

We will help create an environment in which we can all enjoy and share our cultural heritage free from the threat of legal action or censorship.
