The right to protest and express dissent without fear of reprisal is fundamental to a democratic society and
  
the exercise of freedom of speech. The Pirate Party seeks to uphold and protect this right, wherever people wish to make use of it. Withholding labour is also part of the tradition of protest and must also be
  
protected.

**The following policies have been approved by the Political Council and will be sent to the membership to be voted on:**

> -Small groups of protesters will no longer require a permit to hold their protests.
> 
> &nbsp;
> 
> -Ban the practice of inserting undercover agents into protests without first obtaining a warrant. This includes officers removing their badges while monitoring a protest.
> 
> &nbsp;
> 
> -Preserve the integrity of the police force by making it clear that officers instigating criminal acts or encouraging them with intent to escalate a protest or incite others to do so while under cover will be held fully responsible for their actions.
> 
> &nbsp;
> 
> -Have law enforcement adopt an attitude of cooperation rather than confrontation through maintaining open lines of communication between law enforcement and protest leaders.
> 
> &nbsp;
> 
> -Strictly prohibit the confiscation of  cameras, communication or other recording devices by law enforcement in the absence of a court warrant.
> 
> &nbsp;
> 
> -Launch a review of the practice of &#8216;kettling&#8217; and random &#8220;snatch and grab&#8221; of protesters to determine whether the practice leads to a deteriation of public order.
> 
> &nbsp;
> 
> -Protesters shall have the right to protect their identity and anonymity unless being arrested. If released without charge evidence and records gleaned will be destroyed.
