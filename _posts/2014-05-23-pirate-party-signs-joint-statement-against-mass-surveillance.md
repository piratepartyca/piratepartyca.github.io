**&#8220;Over 35 leading academics and 19 organizations sign on in support of the Ottawa Statement on Mass Surveillance, which sets out what needs to be done to protect Canadians from out-of-control mass surveillance&#8221;**

&#8220;ProfessorÂ **David Murakami Wood**, Canada Research Chair in Surveillance Studies, Queen&#8217;s University, said: &#8220;Canada is deploying ever more surveillance in the name of safety and security, but the end result is discrimination, the reduction of privacy and the chilling of free speech. We need to stop and take stock of where Canada is going and if it is the kind of place that we would want to live in.&#8221;&#8221;
