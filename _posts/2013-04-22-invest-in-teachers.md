Schools should have the freedom to spend their budgets as they see fit and should be encouraged to invest in knowledgeable, enthusiastic and well qualified teachers. Over the last decade we have seen vast sums wasted on expensive school IT systems, often with maintenance, software licensing and other excessive or unnecessary costs attached. To make matters worse, schools are often locked into these costly systems for long periods, reducing schools&#8217; abilities to adapt to new technology and provide the best education to their students. An effort needs to be made to ensure that schools are aware of and can collaborate on the use of free and open source software (FOSS), which could save significant amounts of money within education and redirect it back to teaching.
