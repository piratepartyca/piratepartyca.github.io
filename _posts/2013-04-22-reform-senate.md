Reform of the Senate is necessary to ensure the Senate remains relevant and effective as an expert body, and acts as a proper check on the activities of the Commons. However the scope, scale and specifics of any reform are something that needs to be discussed at length and in public. We all have a stake in the future shape of of our democracy.

We intend to start a national discussion about the shape of the Senate and how it can be improved without damaging the work that the Senate does.

Too many parties say &#8220;we will reform senate&#8221; but offer no solutions and never actually reform the body. We strongly desire a change, but want to make sure that the change is right. Town halls and various meetings will inform the best course of action.
