The best time to learn is in the earliest years, but for many people life events can mean that they miss out on education, or due to personal issues they may be incapable of taking full advantage of the education available to them up to the age of 18. We are committed to providing easy access to both basic education and higher education for all; we believe that Canada can build on the excellent foundations already laid by the Open University. University tuition fees should be frozen and eventually scrapped. Tuition fees have a disproportionately negative effect on students from poorer backgrounds, and act as a barrier to intelligent and willing young people&#8217;s development to their full academic potential. We believe that a freeze in tuition fees is necessary until a workable grant based, free, or means tested alternative funding method can be agreed on and implemented.
