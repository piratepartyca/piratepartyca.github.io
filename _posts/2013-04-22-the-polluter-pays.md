We believe that if you damage the environment, it is your responsibility to pay for that damage to be reversed. The air around us, our waterways, and our landscapes are all common property. If they are damaged though an accident or through activity that pollutes, then that damage should be fixed. The government has a duty to ensure that those who cause such damage pay to do so. In the event that damage is global, as with climate change, it is doubly important to ensure that damaging activities are kept to a minimum and that funds are raised to deal with the consequences. It is also vitally important that we invest in research and technology to reduce the amount of damage that we do to our environment in the first place.

A company going bankrupt from fine is not a reason to lower the fines but a deterrent for all companies not to act irresponsibly and carelessly.
