We will be meeting up locally to discuss the Pirate Platform and running candidates in the Vancouver area.

There is no requirement to be a Pirate Party member to participate. We are looking for input from a great variety of ideological backgrounds,

The meeting will be held in the Commercial Drive area.

For directions/to RSVP, e-mail shawn.vulliez@pirateparty.ca
