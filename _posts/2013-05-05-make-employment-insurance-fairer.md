Employment Insurance premiums make up big part of regular deductions on a worker&#8217;s paycheques. Hard working Canadians pay the premium with expectation that it is their insurance should they lose their job. It is important to preserve that trust by making sure workers are paid the entitled amount promptly when the needs arise.

We will make sure funds for Employment Insurance are managed responsibly and all efforts are made to avoid cutting of benefits during times of economic downturn or increased unemployment. We will make it illegal for government officials to divert funds from Employment Insurance to cover other expenses or deficits in other agency or branch of government.

When the Pirate Party introduces the Citizen&#8217;s Income into law, we will look at the overlap between Mincome and and EI to make the systems complimentary and as streamlined as possible.
