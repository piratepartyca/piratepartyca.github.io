At present every person in Canada has access to basic telephone services. If a person is disabled or on a low income, this should not prevent them from having access to basic communications including the Internet. We will ensure that communication providers are required to offer heavily discounted, government subsidized or free basic service to individuals who would otherwise not be able to get internet and telephony service.

We know that Canada&#8217;s future success depends on a modern broadband infrastructure supporting a free and open Internet, but to make the most of it we must aim to end the &#8220;Digital Divide&#8221; and ensure that everyone benefits of being part of a connected information society.
