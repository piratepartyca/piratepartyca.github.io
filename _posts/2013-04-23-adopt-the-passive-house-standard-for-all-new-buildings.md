The Passive House standard requires a house to be be so well constructed and insulated that it is warm enough without requiring much heating; typically it will require no heating at all. 30,000 passive houses have been built around the world and Canada should work to catch up. We will aim to ensure that all new houses built in Canada adhere to a reasonable standard that is as close to the Passive House standard in terms of aims as possible.
