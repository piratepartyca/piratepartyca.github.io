Canada remains a strong economy relative to other nations in the world. We remain a free society that people from some nations could only aspire to. However, it would be negligent on our part to dismiss and downplay the real conditions and challenges that we are facing right now. Our economy is in decline with the flight of jobs to cheaper labour markets and the continued fall in oil prices. The fall in loonie is leading to inflationary price increases in food and commodities. This would hurt Canadians at a time when a lot of personal debt burdens are already increasing as most people continue to struggle to make ends meet. Retirees will also suffer as their pension money loses value. </span></span></span></span>

Our economy&#8217;s over reliance on resources only threatens to create a perfect storm for stagflation. A stagnating economy combined with increasing grocery prices that tax Canadians even more.

  <span style="color: #000000;" color="#000000"><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="3">There is a simple, proven solution supported by economists and political leaders across the political spectrum. The solution does not create inflation through an artificial increase of a devalued money supply. The simple solution simply distributes the money more effectively to the economic driver of a nation, its people. </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;" color="#000000"><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="3"><span>It could serve as a permanent, non-interventionist and non-discriminatory stimulus for our economy.</span></span></span></span>

<p class="western">
  <span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="3">Our laws are increasingly written to favour the few to the detriment of the public interest and its well being. Laws that create more unsustainable conditions and costly government interference, or laws that create burdens on the progress and development of new technologies. This is evident especially in the copyright and patent area of the legislation. Our internet bandwidth and wireless speed remains low compared to other developed and developing countries, while the cost to consumers remains much higher. This is despite the fact that our city&#8217;s densities and customer base are comparable or higher than some of these nations.</span></span>

<p class="western">
  <span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="3">There are several laws from the last session of Parliament and the Senate that have included provisions that are anti-privacy and violate the democratic due process. These bills includes:</span></span>
</p>

  * <p class="western">
      <span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="3">The <a class="extern" href="http://www.lop.parl.gc.ca/content/lop/LegislativeSummaries/41/2/s4-e.pdf">Senate&#8217;s S-4</a>, an act that violates the democratic expectation on protection of personal information by private companies.,</span></span>
    </p>

  * <p class="western">
      <span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="3">The C-13 bill that revamped the infamous child pornographers bill into a so called anti-cyberbullying bill – a bill that creates loopholes for government to bully and violate people&#8217;s privacy.</span></span>

      <span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="3">The C-51 anti-terrorism bill that is fraught with violations of rights and freedoms guaranteed by our constitution, and</span></span>

<p class="western">
  <span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="3">No government that respects our rights and freedoms could let these bills stand as is. They should be repealed and a more focused anti-bullying bill should be introduced. This would include provisions for anti-harassment, pro-whistle blowing and investigative journalism, and pro-due process and privacy protection bills to replace those offending bills. It is Utopian to think a law with so many loopholes for violating rights & freedoms will not be used for that purpose. To combat cyber-bullying, we should look into heavier fines and criminal prosecution for those intentionally using explicit images or videos of someone to blackmail them for personal or political purposes. Criminalize revenge porn and unauthorized recording to distribute explicit video chat that was meant to be private. </span></span>

<p class="western">
  <span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="3"><b>Digital Rights</b></span></span>
</p>

<p class="western">
  <span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="3">Digital rights is nothing new. It is simply an application of our traditional rights and freedoms into the digital sphere. Application of basic democratic principles that have allowed our free society to endure all trials and attempts to compromise it. An indication of a society with healthy digital rights is one where our new medium and information infrastructure, which is used for connecting, trading, and communicating, is non-discriminatory and not unduly restricted or compromised. These digital rights should include:</span></span>
</p>

  * <p class="western">
      <span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="3">That our information structure remains neutral, open, accessible and decentralized.</span></span>
    </p>

  * <p class="western">
      <span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="3">That restrictive technology such as digital locks do not become standard to limit the public&#8217;s access to information and data.</span></span>
    </p>

  * <p class="western">
      <span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="3">That our critical network infrastructure and wireless spectrum and supporting technology, which includes security enabling system such as VPN and encryption, are not weakened to satisfy Geo-blocking, throttling, censorship, and the surveillance needs of government and monopolistic entities. Those compromising acts would threaten Canadian&#8217;s personal private data, financial information and security, thereby leading to increased instances of fraud and criminality. There should not be mandated weakening of security for surveillance purposes. This could prove costly for businesses and the security of their data, leading to flight of businesses to more data secure, friendly locations.</span></span>

Nor should they be able to dictate how traffic, content and information are controlled and limited. We must preserve the original design of the internet, one that promotes openness, decentralization and accessibility without censorship and interference from political and corporate bodies.</span></span></span></span>
    </p>

<p class="western">
  <span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="3">Technology is not a cancer that needs to be controlled, forbidden or destroyed. Undemocratic mass surveillance and censorship will not solve the problems of extremism nor circumvent predatory business practices. There is growing opposition and realization to the folly of ever expanding copyright and patent terms and the criminalization of the sharing of information and culture, or monopolistic restriction using digital locks, and criminalization for accessing data and tinkering to innovate and research. </span></span>

It is time to modernize our democracy by implementing a more proportional system that does not marginalize the independent candidates and those who reside in rural areas. The new system should also not allow a few parties to dominate. Otherwise, it could lead to gridlock, lock down, and voters not having any real alternative choices like what has happened in the U.S. It should do away with the need for strategic voting and instead make every vote really count.</span></span></span></span></span>
</p>

<p class="western">
  <span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="3">To avoid delay in implementing the new system, the use of a tabulating machine that is open source in both software and hardware should be initiated immediately. A way to speed up vote counting while not doing away with the manual audit or counting, and poll watchers. This is not the same as online voting or e-voting, which we remain opposed to at this time, due to security concerns and its lack of a non-coercion guarantee that a voting booth provides.</span></span>

The cost of an effective Mincome is <a class="extern" href="http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~simpson/3360%20papers/BI%20ms%20Dec%2015%2003.pdf">estimated by economists</a> at about $50 billion</span></span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;" color="#000000"><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="3"><span>. This is the variant that uses mean-test to payout only to those in need. By comparison, the ineffective and vote buying tax credits, what economists call the political boutique tax credits cost us about $19 billion. Social transfer just at the federal level alone costs $11 billion. GST Credit to support low income earners is about $3 billion. The ineffective corporate subsidies paid out over 30 years is about $648 billion, averaging about $22 billion per year. Just those factors alone would give a total of $55 billion per year enough to pay for a Mincome program, that can eliminate poverty. </span></span></span></span>

<p class="western">
  <span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: medium;" size="3">If we account for all the expenses that go into supporting poverty related health care, criminal justice and loss of productivity, the cost is pegged at $72 billion Canada wide. That is before accounting for the associated payout and bureaucracy from the Federal to the Municipal level. The municipal or community levels are burdened with huge expenses for maintaining programs to support the welfare program. The payout and bureaucracy surrounding welfare in Canada easily adds an additional $185 billion in cost. That is $257 billion in total cost nationwide, more than the economists&#8217; estimated $200 billion to $252 billion needed to implement an unconditional, universal, non-stigmatizing dividend to all families. </span></span>

When in fact, the major U.S. studio that lobbied for ever increasing copyright terms, to suit their expiring copyrights, are the ones who stole the rights of the work, denying the public access to these works. Works that these monopolistic studios did not originally create but simply derived and remixed. The wider public and independent artists are denied their creative freedom. Patrons of creative works are criminalized instead of being granted a medium for easier access at a reasonable cost more reflective of modern realities. When innovative companies work to satisfy those needs, they are met with throttling, bandwidth discrimination, and Geo-blocking. These overly intrusive measures are regressive and should have no place in the new information and knowledge economy.</span></span>

Perhaps it was being born to parents who have been abused in a residential school and the trauma that led them to alcohol or substance abuse. Or perhaps being born to poverty in an environment of violence and gangs. Or having been forced to run away from an abusive and harassment filled home or neighbourhood. As storm, rain, wind, snow or ice fell, instead of being sheltered in a warm home they try to survive anyway they can in the nooks and crannies of the cold damp street.
