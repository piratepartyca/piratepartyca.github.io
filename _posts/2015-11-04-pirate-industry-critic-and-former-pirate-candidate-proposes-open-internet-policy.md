For Immediate Release

PIRATE PARTY&#8217;S INNOVATION, SCIENCE & ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CRITIC PROPOSES OPEN INTERNET POLICY

Red Deerâ€“Mountain View District, Alberta &#8211; November 4, 2015 &#8211; The Pirate Party of Canada&#8217;s Innovation, Science & Economic Development Critic and former candidate Scott Milne has announced the party&#8217;s first policy for this new term of government. The policy to create an open internet includes the following proposed actions:

* Reject Bell&#8217;s appeal to cabinet against CRTC ruling 2015-326 meant to prevent big telco like Bell from limiting competition and monopolizing the internet fibre network.
  
* Upgrade the undersea transatlantic telecommunications cable from Newfoundland to more direct European locations.
  
* Repeal laws that are anti-privacy and compromise the security and privacy of business data.
  
* Promote Canada as a data privacy safe haven and attract businesses worldwide to setup their data centres here.
  
* Support non-profit co-operatives that provide fibre-to-home for university, research centres and libraries.
  
* Keep spectrum under government ownership to be leased out to private for-profit organizations.
  
* Ensure Sasktel and other non-profit co-ops across the nation get the required spectrum needed to expand their network if they remain a non-profit entity.
  
* Support Sasktel fibre-to-home Infinet or similar community owned initiatives (e.g. rural co-op like O-net.ca) across the country if they remain a non-profit organization.
  
* Use Saskatchewan as a testing ground for a next generation high speed network if the provincial government agrees to keep Sasktel non-profit.
  
* Create laws to allow government to take back auctioned off spectrum if it is used for anti-competitive non net-neutral means.
  
* Launch infrastructure bonds to pay for information infrastructure projects without raising taxes while avoiding or minimizing deficit. Investors will receive interest payments that would otherwise go to foreign or for-profit banks. In addition, once a project is completed, a share of the revenue for the first 5 years gained from the leasing out of this infrastructure to some for-profit companies will be awarded to bond holders.
