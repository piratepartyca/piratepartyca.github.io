Many industries that are essential to Canada (including rail, water, electricity generation and supply, gas
  
supply and other utilities) have been privatized in recent decades, but continue to rely on massive government subsidy for infrastructure investment. These private organisations then take millions in support whilst continuing to provide dividends to their shareholders and massive pay and benefits to their senior staff.

We believe that this is unfair. Where the government spends the taxpayers&#8217; money to ensure the delivery of an essential service, the taxpayer should expect to see a return for their money before private investors are paid dividends. Senior management should have their wages capped.

In addition we will propose that any government subsidy or grant to a profitmaking company for the delivery of services should be met dollar-for-dollar by private investment.
