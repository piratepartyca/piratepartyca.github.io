Fox Creek, AB – March 9th

On Thursday the Prime Ministers Office gave its official replies to questions submitted by MPs regarding salary disclosure of staffers within the PMO making between $150,000 and $300,000 annually.  Additionally, other government officials responded to Order Papers related to their departments, including an inquiry about software running on government computers. The PMO and government officials were less than forthcoming with information, aptly demonstrating the problem with relying on them to disclose information after the fact.

The Pirate Party of Canada considers the current systems that required specific requests to obtain information about government expenditures to be woefully lacking and open to abuse.  The Access to Information Act adds to this issue by allowing for long periods of time before responses to queries and subsequent data can be provided. With the current technological advancements that Canadians have access to, both of these issues can and should be dealt with in a proactive manner by automatically making spending figures publicly available online.

&#8220;In theory this would create no more work for bureaucrats than already exist. One would assume that they would need to enter the information on department spending at some point. Having the computer systems set up to automatically copy spending information to a public government website while removing private and personal information would be a relatively straight forward task&#8221;, says James Wilson, Leader of the Pirate Party of Canada. &#8220;Such a system would be more efficient and transparent. It would also be advantageous to the government by opening its spending up to the most thorough auditor of all; the Canadian public.&#8221;

The Pirate Party of Canada is a federal political party focused on thoughtful information policy reform, genuine democracy, civil liberties, and the freedom of the Internet. You can find out more online at <a class="extern" href="http://www.pirateparty.ca/" target="_blank">www.pirateparty.ca</a> .
