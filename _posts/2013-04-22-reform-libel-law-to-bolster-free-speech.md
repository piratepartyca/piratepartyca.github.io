Canadian defamation law needs a thorough overhaul. At present they present an unacceptable risk to free speech. We will make it clear that the truth is an absolute defence against any defamation claim and significantly reduce the burden and costs faced by defendants in defamation cases.

**The following policies have been approved by the Political Council and will be sent to the membership to be voted on:**

> -The Pirate Party will reform Canadian defamation laws to make truth an absolute defence against charges of defamation.
> 
> &nbsp;
> 
> -We will protect authors and/or publishers who repeat a claim provided they had good reason to believe it to be true and have evidence to support it.
> 
> &nbsp;
> 
> &#8211; Evidence, no matter how a third party obtained it, cannot be excluded from the defense&#8217;s case as long as the defendant had no part in it being obtained.
> 
> &nbsp;
> 
> -Reinforce protection for hosting platforms from liability for the speech of their users.
