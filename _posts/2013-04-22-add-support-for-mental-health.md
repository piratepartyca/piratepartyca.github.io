Some provinces are not providing adequate mental health solutions to their residents, as such the federal government should establish a system which will give incentives to support mental health and addiction programs. Improving the treatment of addicts and mentally ill citizens will reduce the rate of poverty, homelessness, and drug abuse on our streets.
